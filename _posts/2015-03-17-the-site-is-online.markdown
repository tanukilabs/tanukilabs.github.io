Welcome to the new web presence of tanukilabs! The site will be filled with
content over the next days, so be sure to check back if you're interested!

First I pushed a private repository to bitbucket, experimenting with Bootstrap,
which was, in fact, working great. The downside was (yeah, I was faster in creating
the repo etc. than reading the docs) that it could not handle server-side scripts
(PHP for the contact page), so I decided to finally create the tanukilabs
organization on github and just use jekyll instead (which is also
working great, apparently). I'll probably get back to bootstrap for the contact page
and status bars for the games.

I'm looking forward to play around with jekyll in the next few days and upload some
actual content.

That's all for today, folks!
