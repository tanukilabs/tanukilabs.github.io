Today I want to talk about two cool projects I'm really excited about on which we were working for the last few weeks.

###BTB - Rewritten

Bob The Bacterium (BTB) originally was created as a high school programming project written in Lua using the awesome [love framework](http://love2d.org/). This is its revival in C# using [unity](http://unity3d.com/5) including lots of improvements and new features.

Because images say more than a thousand words enjoy a screenshot!

As you can see, it's a platformer. The story briefly explained: Bob & Alice were planning on spending their honeymoon on mars. In order to do so, they took a flight with the Curiosity, which was hijacked by evil bacterium Mallory and his henchmen. They took beloved Alice from Bob and rendered him unconscious. As Bob wakes up, he finds himself on mars beginning his adventure.

I plan on releasing the source code along with the executable approximately at the end of April on bitbucket and github under the [zlib/libpng license](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib). So, should you be interested, please check back then!

I'm very grateful to Elhuron for providing me with awesome space art!

###Famgl

Famgl is a desktop program, that can be used to create and edit lists tailored to media (*F*ilms, *A*nime, *M*anga, *G*ames, *L*iterature). I started
development on it, because I was unhappy with current solutions (imdb, MAL, ....) and wanted to contribute to solve this myself. As this project is currently in quite an early stage
I can't tell you much more at this point.

I'll make sure to keep you updated about both current projects!
Have a nice day.
